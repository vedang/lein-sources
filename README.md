# lein-sources

A leiningen plugin to add sources and javadoc jars to the classpath.

*Note*: This plugin is currently experimental, and I have not published it to clojars yet. I'll do it this week and update the README with clear instructions on usage as well.

## Usage

Put `[lein-sources "0.1.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` or `:repl` profile.
